# Problem Solving

1. Undesrstand the problem

2. Plan
   -Algorithm -> Pseudocode
   -Pseudocode:

   1. When the user inputs a number
   2. Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero
   3. while the counter is smaller than user inputted number increament the counter by one
   4. Print the value of the counter variable

3. Divide and conquer

## Solving Fizz Buzz

Write a program that thes a users input and prints the number from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples og the both three and five print FizzBuzz.
