    <h3>
      Monay is a popular Filipino bread known for its dense texture and slightly
      sweet, milky flavor. It is perfect for breakfast or merienda with a cup of
      coffee or ice-cold juice.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <li>Bread Flour</li>
    <li>Milk powder</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Lukewarm water</li>
    <li>Instant Yeast</li>
    <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
    <li>Egg</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Since this recipe is using instant yeast, the temperature of the
        lukewarm water can range from 115°F/45°C to 130°F/54°C. But if using
        active dry yeast, the water temperature should only range from
        105°F/40°C to 110°F/43°C. Make sure not to use hot water as it may kill
        the yeast.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a room-temperature egg to mix the dough better and for the dough to
        rise easily. If the egg is kept in the fridge, you can warm the egg
        quickly by placing it in a bowl of warm water and let it sit for about
        5-10 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        One of the best ways to know if you've adequately kneaded the dough is
        by doing the "windowpane test". Take a piece of the dough, with your
        fingers, stretch it into a thin square film. The dough must be thin
        enough to let the light pass through without breaking.
      </li>

      <li>
        I suggest using milk for brushing the hot monay after baking. It really
        works best if you like the glossy finish.
