    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <h5>For The Pudding</h5>

    <li>5 cups white bread, torn into little pieces</li>
    <li>2 ¼ cups milk</li>
    <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons red food coloring</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon water</li>

    <h5>For The Dough</h5>

    <li>2 ¼ cups flour + ¼ cup reserved</li>
    <li>1 package (2 ¼ teaspoon) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>¼ cup warm water (105-115 F)</li>
    <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoons salt</li>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Tear the bread into small pieces. In a small bowl, combine the bread,
        milk, beaten eggs, and sugar. Stir well until bread pieces are
        moistened.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the red food coloring and stir until the color is evenly
        distributed.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cover and refrigerate for 15 to 30 minutes to soften the bread and
        absorb more liquid.
      </li>

      <li>
        Transfer the mixture to a medium pan and over medium heat, cook the
        pudding while continually stirring to prevent from sticking to the
        bottom of the pan.
      </li>

      <li>
        When most of the liquid is absorbed, add the butter and stir until
        melted and distributed. Continue to cook the pudding into a chunky,
        paste-like consistency.
      </li>

      <li>
        Turn off the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Let the mixture cool
        completely before using.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine warm water, active dry yeast, and 2
        teaspoons of the sugar. Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes or until
        foamy.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the warm milk, the melted butter, the remaining sugar, and salt.
        Stir everything well with a wooden spoon.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add 2 ¼ cups of flour, about one cup at a time, stirring well after each
        addition. Gradually add and stir in the remaining flour, just until the
        dough gathers up into a shaggy mass.
      </li>

      <li>
        Turn the dough over on a board and knead until it turns from loose and
        shaggy to smooth and elastic.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place the kneaded dough in a bowl and cover with a clean kitchen towel.
        Let rise for 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size.
      </li>

      <li>
        Gently deflate the risen dough and transfer to a flat board. Roll out
        the dough into a 10 x 16-inch rectangle using a rolling pin and slice in
        half horizontally.
      </li>

      <li>
        Spoon a heaping mound of the pudding in the center length of each half.
        Using a spatula, slightly flatten the filling.
      </li>

      <li>
        Fold the edges of the dough towards the middle to cover the pudding and
        pinch the seams to close.
      </li>

      <li>
        Turn the logs around to seam side down and slice the logs to 2-inch
        pieces.
      </li>

      <li>Preheat oven to 350 F.</li>

      <li>
        Arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet and make slits on the top of
        each peice.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cover the pan loosely with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let
        rise for about 30 to 40 minutes or until puffy.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a small bowl, beat the egg with the 1 tablespoon water and brush the
        tops of the dough with the egg wash.
      </li>

      <li>Bake in the oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden.</li>
